# Airline Reservation and Management System

This project was developed as an academic course project for the
Object Oriented Programming course at Yıldız Technical University.

The aim of the project is to model a real-world airline reservation
system by applying object-oriented design principles and basic
concurrency concepts.

## Features
- Object Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- Flight, seat, passenger and reservation management
- Multithreading-based seat reservation simulation
- Synchronized and non-synchronized reservation scenarios
- File-based data persistence (no database)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Unit testing with JUnit

## Technologies
- Java
- Swing 
- JUnit

## Dependencies
